# HomeAssistant MQTT IOT
## In need of a better name

A simple Golang program that currently serves one purpose, which is to turn on/off dark mode on my Linux desktop.
It does so by calling out to a script, which is good, because I can modify the script easier than the Golang.
It uses HomeAssistant MQTT autodiscovery.

Plans are to make a simple script-based system for declaring sensors and switches.
